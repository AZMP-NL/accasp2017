Hi Jen,

Here are some ideas (as they come out of my head) that you can slowly start exploring.
Just read You don't to follow this order.


---- what you can do now (Preliminary stuff) ------

- Join AZMP-NL github organisation so you can read this file.
Get familiar with git (how to pull/commit/push).
Think of an architecture for script/function usage.

- I suggest getting familiar with a reference manager tool (Mendeley, Zotero, JabRef, etc.)

- scholar.google.ca
This is the place to find peer-reviewed papers.
Just start by reading the one in the project description I forwarded to you, and these will bring you to more papers.
I suggest that we add relevant papers that we find in ./paperlist.txt

- https://pangeo-data.github.io/
For your personal knwoledge, visit this page if you have a chance.
This is a fairly new initiative, recently funded by the NSF
These people are possibly the world leaders in term of using big data in Earth science.
Maybe we should explore using 'xarray' for what we are doing?

- Biochemical data have been placed in AZMP-NL/data
A snippet to read the data is here: AZMP-NL/python-toolbox/biochem_database_toPython.py


---- December 2017 (Explore relationship between variables) ----

- Maybe start by exploring how we're going to read the data: Biochem data is quite easy, but how are we going to manipulate 7 decades of T-S data? Is Xarray woth exploring (see Pangeo above)? We keep in pFiles or export everything in NetCDF? Because you are less familiar (and because this is the core of the project) I suggest starting with biochem data, but I'd like that we sit and think about the best way to "data mining" the physical database.

- Do basic biochemical plots such as:
  1999-2016 averages transects for each lines;
  create a function that plots the average profile (with interval of confidence) given a parameter, a time period and a region (lat-lon box);
  
- Explore possible seasonal/interannual decoupling between nitrate, silicate and phosphate at St.27 and elsewhere
(Nitrates-Phosphates & Nitrates-Silicates). See Figures in 'accasp' folder.

- Try any relationship that you might think of after your readings

- (...)

---- January -----

- Start digging into physical data

- Preparation of a poster for OS2018 (meeting starts Feb. 11th)
